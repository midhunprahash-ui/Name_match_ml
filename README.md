> [!NOTE]\
> The `MODEL_TRAINING`, `TRAINED_MODELS`, and related ML files in this repository represent an alternative approach I explored using machine learning to solve the username matching use case. However, after experimentation, I found that traditional string matching algorithms (fuzzy and phonetic matching) deliver more accurate and interpretable results for this specific problem.

Hence, the core files of this project are:
	‚Ä¢	`main.py`
	‚Ä¢	`employee_data.csv`
	‚Ä¢	`templates`/ folder

The ML components are included in the repo for reference only, as part of the experimentation process.

# üîç Username Matching System

This project is a **Flask web application** that takes a username input and predicts the most likely employee(s) it belongs to using intelligent fuzzy matching and phonetic similarity.

---

## üöÄ Features

- Match usernames against employee data using:
  - **Fuzzy string matching** (`thefuzz`)
  - **Phonetic algorithms** (`jellyfish` - Soundex, Metaphone)
  - **Heuristics** (e.g., `emp_ID` presence in username)
- Ranks and returns:
  - **Best matches** (confidence score ‚â• 65)
  - **Top suggestions** if no strong match is found
- Clean web UI for input and result display

## üß† Tech Stack

| Component     | Technology        |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Backend       | Python 3, Flask   |
| Matching Algo | thefuzz, jellyfish|
| Frontend      | HTML (via Jinja)  |
| Data Handling | pandas            |

## üìä Employee CSV Format

Your `employee_data.csv` should include the following columns:

| emp_id | first_name | last_name |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| 101    | Alice      | Johnson   |
| 102    | Bob        | Smith     |

> [!NOTE]\
> You must generate a sample `employee_data.csv` file and save it to your project folder in the format given above to use the application, or use the `employee_data.csv` file uploaded in the repo.
